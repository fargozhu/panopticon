In other words, when I ask to to tell kube to keep the job's memory less than X the operator also forces the memory to be at least X. That is bogus.\n>\n>\n>**To Reproduce**\n>\n>Deployed kubecf `0.2.0-1739.gfa5c9166-d ...(message has been trimmed)\n\nFiled by [@andreas-kupries](http://github.com/andreas-kupries)",
